### Brewing Beer, making Cider and more

This document continues to evolved. It's based on what I have learnt over the
short period of time I've been brewing.

Questions and feedback are welcome. Find something new, new process, please share.

## Websites:
Daily random brew stuff that's on sale - http://www.homebrewfinds.com
Forums - http://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum.php < you can easily spend weeks just reading posts in the forums.

## Brewing Equipment (Essentials):
- Burner
- Kettle (at least 10 Gallons)
- Fermentor (Glass or Plastic carboy 6 gallon size)
- 5 gallon Keg (Ball lock) or bottles - I'd recommend keg to start.
- Star Sans - Sanitation solution
- CO2 bottle and regulator

Nice to haves:
- Wort Chiller - if you are going to brew with others (us) we already have one and you can use it  :)

As far as where to buy the equipment, especially the essentials, you can get a
lot of them used off Craigslist or new from various places.

Wort Chiller - http://www.morebeer.com/products/water-efficient-immersion-wort-chiller-25-38-tubing.html
You can probably find a wort chiller cheaper elsewhere. The one thing you want is the garden hose attachment - which you can rig up together with supplies from a hardware store.

You'll need a hose attached to the end of the siphon which you can also pick up at the hardware store or online.
