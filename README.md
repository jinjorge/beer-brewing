### Brewing Beer, making Cider and more

This document continues to evolve. It's based my learnings over the short period
of time I've been brewing.

Questions and feedback are welcome. If you find something new, new process, please share.
My initial plan is to use this document as a resource for `Starting off Brewing`
that is easy to share and update.

1. [Getting Started](https://github.com/jinjorge/beer-brewing/blob/re-org/Getting_Started.md)

## Websites:
- [Daily random brew stuff](http://www.homebrewfinds.com) that's on sale
- [HomeBrewTalk Forum](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum.php) < you can easily
spend weeks just reading posts in the forums.

Nice to haves:
- Wort Chiller - if you are going to brew with others (us) we already have one
and you can use it  :)

As far as where to buy the equipment, especially the essentials, you can get a
lot of them used off Craigslist or new from various places.

Wort Chiller - http://www.morebeer.com/products/water-efficient-immersion-wort-chiller-25-38-tubing.html
You can probably find a wort chiller cheaper elsewhere. The one thing you want
is the garden hose attachment - which you can rig up together with supplies from a hardware store.

You'll need a hose attached to the end of the siphon which you can also pick up
at the hardware store or online.
